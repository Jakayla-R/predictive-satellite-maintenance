**Satellite Health Monitoring & Predictive Maintenance**

Demonstration of automated satellite telemetry analysis and component failure prediction using machine learning anomaly detection.

**Overview**
This project analyzes satellite telemetry data to identify degradation patterns and predict component failures before they impact mission operations. Built using industry-standard time-series analysis and isolation forest algorithms.

**Key Capabilities**
* Automated anomaly detection across temperature, voltage, and battery metrics
* Predictive failure modeling with 7-day advance warning
* Component health scoring with degradation trend analysis
* Automated diagnostic reporting with visualization

**Technical Approach**
* Isolation Forest algorithm for multivariate anomaly detection
* Rolling statistics for trend identification
* Physics-based degradation modeling for battery and thermal systems
* Automated alert generation for operational thresholds

**Sample Output**
